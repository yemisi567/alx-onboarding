Pseudocode to read in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

Start Program 
Given 3 integers a, b, c
Read the integers
Check if a is not less than or equal to b or it is not less than or equal to c then it is not the smallest
Check if b is less than or equal to c
Then a is not less than or equal to b and b is not less than or equal to c
Print a,b,c
Else
Check if a is not less than or equal to c or c is not less than or equal to the b
Then write a,c,b

Check if b is not less than or equal to a or it is not less than or equal to c then it is not the smallest
Check if a is less than or equal to c
Then b is not less than or equal to a and a is not less than or equal to c
Print b,a,c
Else
Check if b is not less than or equal to c or c is not less than or equal to the a
Then write b,c,a

Check if c is not less than or equal to a or it is not less than or equal to c then it is not the smallest
Check if a is less than or equal to b
Then c is not less than or equal to a and a is not less than or equal to b
Print c,a,b
Else
Check if c is not less than or equal to b or b is not less than or equal to the a
Then write c,b,a
